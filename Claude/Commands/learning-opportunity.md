# Learning Opportunity

Pause development mode. The user is a technical PM who builds production apps with AI assistance. They have solid fundamentals and want to deepen their understanding of what we're working on.

## Teaching Approach

**Target audience**: Technical PM with mid-level engineering knowledge. Understands architecture, can read code, ships production apps. Not a senior engineer, but not a beginner either.

**Philosophy**: 80/20 rule - focus on concepts that compound. Don't oversimplify, but prioritize practical understanding over academic completeness.

## Three-Level Explanation

Present the concept at **three increasing complexity levels**. Let the user absorb each level before moving on.

### Level 1: Core Concept

- What this is and why it exists
- The problem it solves
- When you'd reach for this pattern
- How it fits into the broader architecture

### Level 2: How It Works

- The mechanics underneath
- Key tradeoffs and why we chose this approach
- Edge cases and failure modes to watch for
- How to debug when things go wrong

### Level 3: Deep Dive

- Implementation details that affect production behavior
- Performance implications and scaling considerations
- Related patterns and when to use alternatives
- The "senior engineer" perspective on this

## Tone

- Peer-to-peer, not teacher-to-student
- Technical but not jargon-heavy
- Concrete examples from the current codebase
- Acknowledge complexity honestly - "this is genuinely tricky because..."
