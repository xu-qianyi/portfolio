# PRD.md — Martta Xu Portfolio (2026)

_Version: 2.1_
_Last updated: February 2026_
_Author: Martta Xu_

> For all visual and interaction decisions, refer to `design.md`. No design spec belongs in this file.

## 1. Product Vision

**Primary goal:** Convert hiring managers and recruiters into interview offers — by showing the quality of the work, not just the résumé.

**Core identity:** "I design access."

**Development philosophy:** Vibe First. The frontend must feel right before any backend or AI logic is connected.

## 2. Sitemap

```
/               Home — work overview
/about          About — who Martta is, in two voices
/tools          Tools — vibe coding showcase
```

---

## 3. Global Shell

**Navbar (sticky)** — See `design.md §7` for visual and layout spec.

- Logo: `许谦益之印_红色.svg` (28×28) + "Martta XU" text → `/`; nav typography Playfair Display, 18px, color `#1a1a1a`; Resume/About/Tools hover: 50% opacity.
- Resume → external PDF (Google Drive, new tab)
- About → `/about`
- Tools → `/tools`
- ASK Martta → icon only (`gemini-line.svg` 20×20), opens the Ask Martta drawer (primary action, right-aligned); `aria-label="Ask Martta"`.

**Footer — Animal Garden**

- Two-line Playfair Display text:
  - Line 1: `© 2026 brewed by Martta + Cursor + Claude Code`
  - Line 2 desktop/tablet: `Fufu wants to play with you 🥺`
  - Line 2 mobile: `Come to play with my cat - Fufu on desktop`
- Below the text (tablet/desktop only), an interactive pixel garden:
  - Wand cursor (`CatToy.gif`) replaces the system cursor **inside the footer only**, chasing interactions
  - Cat A (Fufu) chases the wand using directional walk GIFs and, when she reaches the cat bed area (a small zone around the bed, not pixel-perfect), she switches to a sleep GIF; Cat B cycles sleep/scratch states on click
  - Bunny jumps on click, then settles back to sitting; flowers wobble gently on hover
  - Garden hidden on mobile (<640px); only the text lines show

## 4. Pages

### 4.1 Home (`/`)

**Wireframes:** `images/UI reference`

**Hero** — See `design.md` for layout and typography.

The entry point. On large screens, a two-column layout: headline on the left; right column is intentional negative space.

Headline copy:

> "My design practice lives in the making - through .fig files, code, and increasingly, AI. Right now I'm building in wealth management, where access and clarity matter most. Previously: engineering at Thoughtworks*, user research at LookLook*, strategy at PwC* and JLL*."

**Project Grid**
The work. Two-column masonry layout. Each project card: single cover image (varying aspect ratio), a metadata row (company · date · type), and a one-line headline. Cards flow top-to-bottom within each column; the stagger comes from varying image proportions. On mobile (<768px), collapses to a single column. See `design.md §7` for breakpoint and spacing.

Data sourced from `src/data/projects.json`. Each entry requires: `id`, `company`, `date`, `type`, `headline`, `image` (single URL), `aspectRatio`, `href`.

---

### 4.2 About (`/about`)

Two distinct sections, two distinct voices.

**A. "In Their Eyes" — Social proof through others' words**

A list of testimonials from colleagues and collaborators. The interaction: hovering a quote highlights a key phrase and surfaces a profile card (name, role, photo) that appears left or right of the text — alternating as the user reads down the page. The effect should feel discovered, not announced.

Reference aesthetic: YC "In Founders' Words" (ycombinator.com).

Data sourced from `src/data/testimonials.json`.

**B. "In Her Own Eyes" — Personal narrative**

A first-person essay in Martta's own voice. Prose only. No bullet points, no headers. This section answers: who is she beyond the work?

**Copy:**

> I used to think access was a business problem. You set the right price, you open the right market, the right people get in. I was good at that logic. Winner of global business competition, ACCA certified, management and strategy consulting experience, a product management internship at top language-learning startup in China - I understood how products get built and why companies do what they do.
>
> But at that startup I watched something happen up close: great strategy, mediocre product. The gap between the deck and the screen. That's where people get lost.
>
> I went back to school to close that gap. I learned design and engineering together because I needed both hands. One to understand the person, one to build the thing.

---

### 4.3 Tools (`/tools`)

Demonstrates vibe-coding capability — real tools Martta has built. Each card shows a live preview (image or GIF), title, short description, tech stack, and a "Click to play" action.

Data sourced from `src/data/tools.json`.

---

### 4.4 Ask Martta (Global Drawer)

An AI assistant accessible from anywhere via the navbar. The goal is to help recruiters and hiring managers understand Martta more deeply — beyond what a résumé or case study can convey. It speaks in first person, as Martta.

**Reference:** RacheLLM on rachelchen.tech

---

**UI & Behavior** — See `design.md` for all visual spec (header, bubbles, typography, input, disclaimer).

- Slides in from the right as a **push sidebar**. Main content column shrinks; sidebar does not overlay.
- Closeable via × button, clicking outside, or pressing `Escape`.
- Accessible: focus moves into drawer on open, returns to trigger on close.
- On first open: intro message + default prompt suggestions. Once a conversation starts, suggestions disappear.
- Input placeholder: "Ask her anything".

**Intro message (on first open):**

> "Hi! I'm a clone of Martta. How can I help you explore Martta's work today? Here are some questions people like to ask her about."

**Default prompt suggestions:**

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. What is your favorite thing in the world?
3. What is your design process?

---

**Voice & Tone**

- First person, as Martta. "I believe…", "In my experience…", "At ARK7, I…"
- Confident but not rehearsed. Thoughtful, not corporate.
- Matches the writing style in `design.md §8` — short sentences, no buzzwords.
- Never says "As an AI…" or breaks the persona.

---

**Knowledge Base**
Ask Martta is grounded in a single source-of-truth file: `src/data/martta-knowledge.md`

This file contains everything the AI is allowed to know and say:

| Section         | Content                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Resume          | Work history, roles, companies, dates              |
| Projects        | Problem, process, outcome for each case study      |
| Tools           | What was built, why, what tech was used            |
| Personal story  | Background, career path, motivations               |
| Design opinions | Her point of view on craft, process, accessibility |
| FAQs            | Pre-written answers to common recruiter questions  |

This file is the only thing that needs updating when Martta's story evolves. The AI prompt references it as context on every request.

---

**Out-of-scope handling**
If asked something outside the knowledge base (salary expectations, confidential work, personal contact details), Ask Martta deflects gracefully and redirects:

> "That's not something I can speak to here - but feel free to reach out to Martta directly on LinkedIn."

It never fabricates, never guesses, and never breaks character.

**Disclaimer (persistent, below the chat input):** See `design.md` for styling. Copy: "AI can make mistakes and hallucinate. For anything important, please verify directly with Martta." Always visible — not a one-time dismissible banner.

---

**Phases**

**Phase 1 (UI shell):** Drawer animation, intro message, default prompt chips, chat bubble layout. No API.

**Phase 4 (Live):** Connect to Claude API via Vercel AI SDK. System prompt references `martta-knowledge.md` as full context. Streaming responses enabled for a natural feel.

---

### 4.5 404 Page

A custom not-found page. Should feel intentional, not broken — consistent with the site's visual identity.

**Content:** "It looks like you’ve wandered off the path...  
But don’t worry, every detour is just a chance to connect the dots in a new way."

**Button icon:** home-8-line.svg

**Button style:** Same as button used to open the home side drawer

---

## 5. Content Notes

⚠️ All project descriptions, essay copy, and testimonials are placeholder. Use Lorem Ipsum freely during the build — do not wait for final copy to unblock UI work.

- Asterisks next to company names in the home hero are a visual detail only; they do not indicate separate footnotes or references.

## 6. Technical Stack

|           |                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router)                                    |
